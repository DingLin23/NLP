What I did:

Preprocessed files, classified reviews, and included add one smoothing

Problems that I had:

I wasn't able to complete the project. Wasn't able to deal with a large dataset within the movie-review-HW2 folder for negative and positive reviews

Conclusions:

For question 1 my conclusion was that it was classified as negative, and for question 2 part A, B, and C, it was classified as action
